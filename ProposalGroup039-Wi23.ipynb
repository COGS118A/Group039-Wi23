    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

We hypothesise that this algorithm will work well on the dataset due to the fact that XGBoost is known to work well on such dataset, i.e: XGBoost is a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks. We can further strengthen this hypothesis by first running multiple ML algorithms on the dataset: logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. We can determine which one performed best on the dataset via metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Implementing XGBoost on this dataset is as simple as using the XGBoost library.\n",
